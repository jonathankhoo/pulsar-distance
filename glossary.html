<h3>Declination (Dec)</h3>

Pulsar positions on the celestial sphere are specified right ascension and declination.  Declination is the celestial equivalent of terrestrial latitude - the angle of the pulsar above, or below, the celestial equator.

      <h3>Dispersion</h3> 

         If space was a perfect vacuum then electromagnetic radiation, including the radio emission from pulsars, would travel through at a fixed velocity, the speed of light in a vacuum. Within galaxies however, the interstellar medium (ISM) includes free electrons and other particles so is not a true vacuum. As electromagnetic waves travel through this ISM they undergo a change in velocity, they slow down. This is actually an example of refraction, a change in velocity due to change in medium. For electromagnetic waves such as radiowaves, the lower the frequency of the wave, the more it is refracted or slowed down. For radio emissions form a pulsar this means that the different frequency components of the emission appear to smear or spread out as they travel from the pulsar to the radio telescope. The high frequency emission arrives before the lower frequency emissions. This is termed <em>dispersion</em>. The <em>Dispersion Measure</em> (DM) is simply a measure of this - the higher the DM, the more the pulse profile is smeared out. If we assume a uniform density of the ISM within the galaxy then we can relate the DM to the distance to a pulsar. The higher its DM, the further the pulsar is away from us.

<h3>Fermi</h3>

The Fermi gamma-ray space telescope is described <a href="http:fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov">here</a>. It is used to observe gamma-ray emission from astronomical objects including pulsars. The PULSE@Parkes project observes a selection of the gamma-ray emitting pulsars using the Parkes radio telescope in order to provide information on the rotational behaviour of these pulsars to the Fermi team.

      <h3>Frequency</h3> 

     Frequency (<em>f</em> or &nu;) is a measure of the number of wavefronts or cycles that occur per unit of time. The S.I. unit of frequency is the <em>hertz</em>, Hz. 1 Hz = 1 cycle per second. In radioastronomy the frequencies observed are in the range of 100 MHz to 100 GHz or so. Pulsars are typically studied in the radio waveband frequencies of around 1400 MHz although they emit at a wide range of frequencies.

<h3>Glitch</h3>

A pulsars rotational period usually increases very steadily (i.e. the pulsar gradually slows down).  Sometimes a "glitch event" occurs during which the pulsar suddenly spins faster.  The reason for these events is unknown but may be related to the interior structure of the neutron star.  

      <h3>Interstellar medium</h3> 

 Contrary to popular opinion space is not a perfect vacuum. Within a galaxy such as the Milky Way the space between the stars is filled with a tenuous range of material that provides the building blocks of stars. This material is gas and dust and collectively is known as the interstellar medium (ISM). The ISM gas is predominantly hydrogen whilst the dust is about 1% by mass and includes carbon compounds and silicates. Dust is responsible for the interstellar reddening and extinction of starlight. The more of the ISM a star's light travels through on its way to an observer on Earth the more it gets scattered and absorbed, decreasing the star's apparent brightness and reddening its appearance. Properties of the ISM vary widely depending upon its location within a galaxy. At its most tenuous, in hot regions between denser clouds, it may have a density of only 100 particles per cubic metre, mostly ionised hydrogen atoms. In the inner regions of shells of gas surrounding stars the density can be as high as 10<sup>17</sup> particles per m<sup>3</sup> although this is still a million times less dense than a normal vacuum on Earth.

      <h3>Light year</h3> 
   
      A light year (ly) is a unit of measure of distance, not time. It is defined to be the distance light would travel in one year if it was in a vacuum. As light travels about 300,000 km per second in a vacuum a light year (2.99792458 x 10<sup>8</sup> m<sup>-1</sup> to be exact) one light year = 9.460 x 10<sup>15</sup>m or 63,240 Astronomical Units. 

<h3>Local mean sidereal time (LMST)</h3>

Sidereal time is a time keeping system that allows the Parkes telescope to be pointed at a given object in the sky.  A sidereal day is 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4 seconds which corersponds to the time it takes the Earth to complete one rotation relative to the vernal equinox.

      <h3>Neutron star</h3> 

      Neutron stars are very dense, only ten or twenty kilometres across, but more about 1.4 to 3 x the mass of our Sun. They are formed in supernova explosions. A massive star undergoing core collapse produces a Type II supernova. What happens to the core material that is not ejected depends on its mass. The photodisintegration of iron in the last stages of the massive star's life releases protons that in turn react with electrons to form neutrons. These neutrons combine with existing core material to form neutron degenerate matter. Core collapse is halted by the degeneracy pressure of the neutrons if the mass is less than about 3 solar masses. The result is one of the most intriguing types of objects in the Universe, a neutron star.
<p>
Neutron stars are composed of degenerate neutron matter with a density about that of atomic nuclei, ~ 10<sup>17</sup> kg m<sup>-3</sup>. A thimble-full of this material has a mass of almost 10<sup>9</sup> tonnes. They range in mass from a lower value equal to the Chandrasekhar Limit of 1.4 solar masses up to about 3 solar masses. This upper limit is not well-defined and may be up to 5 solar masses in some models. A neutron star is typically about 10 km across. We thus have a very exotic object with twice the mass of the Sun packed into a sphere the size of a small city! Due to the conservation of angular momentum, a neutron star spins at a high rate. Whereas a star such as the Sun rotates on its axis roughly once a month, a neutron star can rotate dozens of hundreds of times a second. This is analogous to an ice skater spinning faster as they draw their arms in close to their body.
<p>
The high rotational speed means that the surface of neutron stars are travelling at relativistic speeds. The gravitational pull on the material must be enormous to prevent the layer being ripped off. The acceleration due to gravity at the surface of a neutron star is of the order of 10<sup>12</sup> m s<sup>-2</sup> compared with 10 m s<sup>-2</sup> at the surface of the Earth. Any material that falls onto its surface would thus be ripped apart and smeared one atom thick on the surface.

<h3>Nulling</h3>

Most pulsars are very stable emitters.  However, when astronomers study individual pulses from some pulsars they notice that some are missing.  The pulsar simply seems to "switch-off" for a few rotations.  There are a few pulsars where the pulse actually switches off for a very long period of time.  These are known as "extreme nullers".  For instance, one pulsar switches off for approximately 20 days and then turns on and behaves as a normal pulsar for around one week before switching off again.  A few pulsars in the PULSE@Parkes sample are extreme nullers.
    
      <h3>Parkes radio telescope</h3> 

      The Parkes radio telescope is a 64-m dish antenna located about 20km from the town of Parkes in the Central West region of NSW. Opened in 1961, the Parkes dish is one of the telescopes operated by the Australia Telescope National Facility, part of the CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science division within CSIRO. Whilist it operates mostley as a single-dish telescope it can also be linked electronically with other ATNF radio telescopes at Narrabri and Coonabarabran to form the 300km Australia Telescope. These can be further linked with telescopes in Canberra, Hobart and Ceduna in South Australia to form the Long Baseline Array. The Parkes radio telescope is one of the world's premier raio telescopes and is a superb instrument with which to conduct observations of pulsars.

<h3>Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA)</h3>

<a href="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/ppta">The Parkes Pulsar Timing Array project</a> (PPTA) is an ongoing research project with the main aim of detecting gravitational waves by observing pulsars.  The PULSE@Parkes sample contains some of the millisecond pulsars that are also included in the PPTA project.


      <h3>Pulsar</h3> 
An overview of pulsars is given <a href="http://outreach.atnf.csiro.au/education/everyone/pulsars">here</a>.    In brief, the first pulsar was discovered by Jocelyn Bell and Anthony Hewish in 1976. The emission that they saw was called a "pulsar" as the signal came in pulses.  Pulsars are now thought to be "neutron stars" - very dense, fast spinning stars that have a radius of only about 10km, but possess a very large magnetic field.  Charged particles moving along the magnetic field lines cause beams of radiation to be emitted from the magnetic poles.  As the neutron star rotates the beam sweeps across space.  If we are fortuitous then the beam may sweep across our line-of-sight and we will be able to detect the pulses. Pulsars keep exceptionally good time. Most of them 'pulse' at a rate between ten times a second and once every three seconds; some spin around hundreds of times a second. Pulsars have a mass of about 1.4 to 3 solar masses compacted into a sphere about 10 km across.

      <h3>Radiation</h3> 

      The word 'radiation' has two different meanings, which can be confusing. First, there is electromagnetic radiation. This is thought of as travelling as 'waves' through space. Light, radio waves, X-rays, infrared and ultraviolet rays are all kinds of electromagnetic radiation. This is what astronomers are usually talking about when they refer to 'radiation'. Second, there is 'ionising radiation' - the radiation that we associate with radioactive materials and nuclear power. Much of this is actually sub-atomic particles: neutrons, protons and electrons. Gamma rays, which are also produced by nuclear processes, can be thought of either as 'ionising radiation' or as a very short wavelength kind of electromagnetic radiation.


      <h3>Radio wave</h3> 

Radio waves are the components of the electromagnetic spectrum that have a wavelength greater than 1 mm (1 x 10<sup>-3</sup> m).

      <h3>Receiver</h3> 

      A receiver is the part of a radio telescope that receives the radio emissions from space. Radio receivers amplify the incoming signal about a million times. Parkes has a suite of receivers that are optimised for different frequency ranges and applications. The receivers are cryogenically cooled, typically with helium gas refrigerators that cool them to about 10 Kelvin (-260 degrees C) to minimise the thermal noise in the electronics that would otherwise swamp the incoming signal.
<p>
For pulsar observations at Parkes observers typically use either the central beam of the Parkes Multibeam receiver, the HOH receiver, both of which detect 21 cm (1420 MHz) radiation or the Dual-Band receiver that can observe at 10 cm and 50 cm simultaneously.

<h3>RFI</h3>

RFI stands for "Radio Frequency Interference" and corresponds to radio waves that are produced on Earth.  For instance, RFI occurs at the Parkes Observatory because of visitor mobile phones, electronic cameras as well from digitial TV transmission and computers on site.

<h3>Right ascension (RA)</h3>

Pulsar positions on the celestial sphere are specified right ascension and declination.  Right ascension is the celestial equivalent of terrestrial longitude.

<h3>Universal Coordinated Time (UTC)</h3>

A terrestrial time standard (formally known as Greenwich mean time) developed by combining data from a large number of atomic clocks Worldwide.  The time of pulses from pulsars are  usually determined with respect to this time scale.

      <h3>Wavelength</h3> 

      Wavelength (&lambda;) is the distance between any two adjacent points in phase in a wave or oscillation. It is commonly described as the lenght between adjacent wave crests. The S.I. unit for wavelength is the meter, <em>m</em>. Any electromagnetic wave with a wavelength greater than 1 mm is a radiowave. For PULSE@Parkes we are typically obsevring at wavelenghts of about 20 cm, corrsponding to a frequency of about 1400 MHz. Frequency, wavelength and velocity are related in the wave equation:<br>
      <em>v</em> = <em>f&lambda;</em><p>
