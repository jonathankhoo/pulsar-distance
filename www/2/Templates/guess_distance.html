<p> You have decided to measure the distance to PSR [@PULSAR_NAME]. First you must estimate how far away you think the pulsar is. Consider whether the pulsar is bright (and therefore probably quite close) or faint.  To help remember that the distance from the Earth to the moon is only 0.00000004 light years, the distance from the Earth to the Sun is 0.00002 light years and the distance from the Earth to the edge of the Solar System is 0.0006 light years. The distance to nearest star outside of our Solar System (Proxima Centauri) is 4.2 light years, the distance to the centre of our galaxy is 25000 light years and the distance to a relatively close by galaxy (the Andromeda galaxy) is 2.5 million light years!
